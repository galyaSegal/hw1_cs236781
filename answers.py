part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. It allows estimation of the performance of the model on unseen data, so we can estimate how well it generalized.
2. We will select a subset of the data which best represents the dataset.
3. The test set should be used **only** when evaluating the performance of the model. 
The validation set is used for cross-validation and for the decision of the best model to be used.

Write your answer using **markdown** and $\LaTeX$:
```python
# A code block
a = 2
```
An equation: $e^{i\pi} -1 = 0$

"""

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**
Yes, we need to set aside some data for validation in order to tune hyperparameters and choose the best model. 
Using the test set for that purpose means overfitting on the test set ('cheating'). 
In such case we can't evaluate how well the model generalizes.
